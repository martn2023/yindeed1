THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF SCOPE TODAY, BUT MAY COME INTO PLAY AS PRODUCT EVOLVES


OVERALL:

USER MANAGEMENT:

1. Yindeed employees are conveniently designated as "is staff", but does that give them super admin powers?
    At scale, we might want people who can't change the system settings, but can moderate:
        removing a job posting with inappropriate materials
        banning a user account


EMPLOYER ORGS:
    from yindeed side


    from poster side
        designating industries/or one single industry





JOB POSTINGS
    from poster side
        setting a role within a certain function (mutually exclusive)



    from seeker side
        see jobs from orgs in a certain industry or within a certain function
        reporting job posts
